    "# What is Geospatial Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "- Geospatial Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that combines geospatial analysis with data science techniques to extract insights, patterns, and knowledge from location-based data. It involves the collection, processing, analysis, and visualization of data that has a geographic or spatial component. Geospatial Data Science is used to solve complex problems in various domains, such as urban planning, environmental monitoring, disaster management, agriculture, transportation, and more.\n",

    "## Key Components of Geospatial Data Science\n",
    "### 1. Geospatial Data\n",
    "Geospatial data refers to any data that has a geographic or spatial component. It can be represented in two main formats:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Vector Data: Represents geographic features as points, lines, and polygons (e.g., cities, roads, land parcels).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Raster Data: Represents geographic features as grids of cells or pixels (e.g., satellite imagery, elevation models).\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of geospatial data include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Satellite imagery.\n",
    "\n",
    "- GPS data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maps.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Proximity Analysis: Measuring distances between features (e.g., finding the nearest hospital).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overlay Analysis: Combining multiple layers of data (e.g., overlaying flood zones with population data).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Network Analysis: Analyzing connectivity and flow (e.g., finding the shortest path in a road network).\n",
